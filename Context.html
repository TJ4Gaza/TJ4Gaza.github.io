                <h4>The idea and purpose of TJG</h4>
                <p>Againts the below background, TJG started as an initiative to cure the inefficiency and bias of the international order with the ultimate purpose of delivering transitional justice to the victims and survivors of Gaza.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Background</h4>

                <h5>1. The United Nations Security Council</h5>
                <p>The atrocities in Gaza, as committed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF), are being sponsored by USA, which 1) on 18 October 2023, vetoed a UN Security Council Resolution that was intended to affect “humanitarian pauses” to deliver lifesaving aid to Gaza population; and 2) on 08 December 2023, vetoed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</p>

                <h5>2. The International Criminal Court (ICC)</h5>
                <p>The developments presented below regarding the two situations, i.e. Palestine and Registered Vessels of Comoros, Greece and Cambodia, attest to the ICC Prosecutor’s bias and/or incompetence as far as Palestine is concerned.</p>

                <h6 class="ml-4 text-decoration-underline">2. a) Situation in the State of Palestine</h6>
                <p>On 01 January 2015, the government of Palestine lodged a declaration under Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute accepting the jurisdiction of the Court over alleged crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. Only on 20 December 2019, the Prosecutor of the Court announced an opening of an investigation into the relevant alleged crimes. It took 5 years for the Prosecutor to complete its preliminary assessment and merely determine that the underlying alleged crimes fall under its jurisdiction.</p>

                <h6 class="ml-4 text-decoration-underline">2. b) Situation of the Registered Vessels of Comoros, Greece and Cambodia</h6>
                <p>On 14 May 2013, the Prosecutor of the Court decided not to investigate the 31 May 2010 Israeli raid on the Humanitarian Aid Flotilla bound for Gaza Strip, because, to the Prosecutor, the matter was insufficiently grave and, hence, inadmissible pursuant to Article 17(1)(d) of the Rome Statute. The Prosecutor, however, determined that the available information provides a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed by IDF on one of the vessel, i.e. Mavi Marmara.</p>
                <p>The Prosecutor’s decision not to investigate was heavily criticized by the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I in its decision on the matter dated 16 July 2015. The Chamber requested that the Prosecutor should reconsider its decision not to investigate, given its errors in, inter alia:</p> 

                <ul class="text-align">
                    <li>Correctly appreciating the nature of the identified crimes; and</li>
                    <li>Assessing the manner of commission of the identified crimes, in particular with respect to the question whether the identified crimes may have been “systematic or resulted from a deliberate plan or policy to attack, kill or injure civilians”.</li>
                </ul>
                	
                <p>On 27 July 2015, the Prosecutor appealed the Pre-Trial Chamber I before the ICC Appeal Chamber, which, on 06 November 2015, dismissed the appeal in limine (a Latin legal term that means “from the outset”).</p>
                <p>On 29 November 2017, the Prosecutor indicated that it remains to be of the view that there is no reasonable basis to investigate the Gaza Flotilla raid. In its decision dated 15 November 2018, the same Pre-Trial Chamber, for the second time, asked the Prosecutor to reconsider its decision not to investigate.</p>
                <p>In the appeal proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor, the Pre-Trial Chamber’s second decision was, again, confirmed, on 02 September 2019, by the Appeals Chamber, which requested the Prosecutor to make a second reconsideration of its decision not to investigate. The Prosecutor never made such reconsideration and declared that its 29 November 2017 decision not to investigate is final.</p>
